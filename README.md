# Evaluation of Molecular Dynamics-Based Modeling for Electric Field-Stimulated X-Ray Crystallography

Thesis presented for a BA with honors in Chemical and Physical Biology at Harvard University (2021)

Protein X-ray crystallography encompasses a wide variety of techniques and research
interests, aimed at determining protein structures at the atomic level. Electric Field
Stimulated X-Ray Crystallography (EF-X) is a time-resolved method that focuses on the
propagation of motion within proteins by capturing the conformational changes induced
by the application of high-voltage pulses. A major challenge with EF-X lies in the eventual
dielectric breakdown of the crystals due to gradual heating from electric field-induced ion
flow. Such heating ultimately limits the longest timescale accessible by EF-X experiments.
Here, I propose a framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the protein
crystal during an EF-X experiment to directly assess the movement of ionic groups. I
compare this framework against experimental studies of protein crystals and a published
EF-X experiment in order to confirm that it reproduces the main features of the
experiment. In this framework, I will then quantify the effects of different experimental
modifications on ionic currents through the protein crystal to enable EF-X studies
accessing slower conformational dynamics.
